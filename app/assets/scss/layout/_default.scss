/// This file is intended for defining default layout styles
/// that apply across the entire project. Use this file to set up
/// foundational layout rules, such as container widths, grid systems,
/// spacing, or alignment utilities that are not specific to any
/// single component. Keep these rules generic and reusable to
/// provide a consistent layout structure throughout the project.
