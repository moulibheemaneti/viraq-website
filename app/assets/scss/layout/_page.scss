/// This file is intended for defining page-specific layout styles.
/// Use this file to set up layout rules that are unique to certain
/// pages, such as custom containers, grids, or spacing that should
/// not be applied globally. Keep these styles scoped to individual
/// pages to maintain a clear separation between global, default,
/// and page-level layout rules.
