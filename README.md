“Pause. Breathe. Recharge.”

## Product Origin

Derived from the Sanskrit word "Virāma" (विराम), meaning "pause" or "rest," and "Q" signifying "Cue" or "Reminder." The name reflects the app's core purpose: to provide timely prompts for users to pause, recuperate, and recharge in their daily digital lives.
